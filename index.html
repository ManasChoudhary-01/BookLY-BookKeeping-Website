                            author and cartoonist Jeff Kinney. The series has been ongoing since the first book was published in 2007, with
                            new books still being published today. Like many of Kinney's books, Double Down sold extremely
                            well, becoming one of the top sellers of 2016—the year it was originally published. Several
                            Diary of a Wimpy Kid books have been adapted for film, but Double Down is not yet one of
                            them. Double Down features the same characters as previous Wimpy Kid books. It is written in the
                            form of a middle-school boy's diary. There are highly stylized illustrations throughout the
                            text to accompany the story.

The novel depicts the plight of the French peasantry demoralized by the French aristocracy in the years leading up to the revolution, the corresponding brutality demonstrated by the revolutionaries toward the former aristocrats in the early years of the revolution, and many unflattering social parallels with life in London during the same period. It follows the lives of several characters through these events.All but three of Dickens's previous novels had appeared only as monthly installments.</div>
